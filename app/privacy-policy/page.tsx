                  this may include:
                  <br />‍<strong>Personal Information:</strong> Such as your
                  name, email address, and contact information provided during

                  Records of the credit packages purchased, including date,
                  time, and amount.

                  We do not collect or store any additional personal information
                  beyond what is explicitly provided by you during the purchase
                  process. This ensures that we respect your privacy while

                <h3>Information Security</h3>
                <p className="paragraph-banner">
                  We take the security of your information seriously and
                  implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative,
                  and organizational measures to protect your data, both online
                  and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
                  disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note
                  that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic
                  storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
                  acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot
                  guarantee its absolute security. Therefore, you should take
                  special care in deciding what information you share with us
                  through the Dressy.app website or email.

                <h3>Data retention</h3>
                <p className="paragraph-banner">
                  We will retain your personal information, including data
                  necessary for the functionality of the cross-device
                  synchronization, such as your settings and other information,
                  only for as long as necessary to provide the Dressy.app
                  website&#39;s services to you, or for other legitimate
                  business purposes such as resolving disputes, safety and
                  security reasons, or complying with our legal obligations.
                  <br />
                  The length of time we retain your personal information will
                  depend on several factors, including:
                  <br />
                  1) The amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information.
                  <br />
                  2) The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or
                  disclosure.
                  <br />
                  3) The purposes for which we process your information.
                  <br />
                  4) Any legal requirements we may be subject to.

                <p className="paragraph-banner">
                  Where required by law we will only send you marketing
                  information, including sending you updates and information
                  about our new products and services, upcoming events or other
